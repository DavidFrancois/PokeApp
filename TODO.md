# Client

## Details page

  - Manage display
- Access via specific url for bookmark : .../pokemon/name/details
  
## Data management

- Prefetch infos about pokemon 
  - Prefetch strategy : Simple Http request or Web Worker
  - Keep data in memory ? How to manage it properly w/ react (in app memory, local Storage etc) define best strategy 
  
## Search Engine
 
- Handle not found and proposals
- If enough time : Auto-complete or live proposals

# Server

- Define clearly what API is supposed to do
- User authentication
- Models
- DB communication

# Deployement

- If enough time dockerize everything (seems complicated)

# Pain points 

- React is way more different from Angular than expected (seems quite logic thought)
- Focus on raw features to polish later
- Feature dev time management
